# Treemap
CS 210 Class Project

## Overview
Data Visualization using Treemaps

### About Treemaps
[Treemaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping) were
introduced by [Schneiderman and Wattenberg in 2001](
https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/102377.115768)
as a space-efficient display for hierarchical (tree-structured) data.
Tree-mapping requires an approach to _tiling_, the subject of the 
first part of the project, and to interpreting hierarchical structure 
in the data, the subject of the second part.

## My Contribution

I wrote mapper.py, which is the main driver and visualization module containg the logic of
generating a treemap.
My instructor provided some of the other modules, including the graphics package, some simple
geometry functions, and treemap.py, which utilizes the logic in mapper.py to construct a treemap
